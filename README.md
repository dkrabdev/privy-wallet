# Privy Wallet

This repository contains a POC application that demonstrates how to create a crypto wallet using the Privy SDK. The goal is to explore whether the Privy SDK can be leveraged to build a general-purpose crypto wallet with features such as email/social login for authentication, signing messages, and executing transactionsâ€”all without requiring key management in the application code. The ultimate objective is to simplify user onboarding for a new kind of generic crypto wallet.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Copy the `.env` file to `.env.local`.  
   If you intend to use the default Privy and WalletConnect applications, no additional setup is required.  
   Otherwise, you'll need to:
   - **Create an account on [Privy](https://dashboard.privy.io/)** and set up a project.
   - **Create an account on [WalletConnect](https://cloud.reown.com/)** and set up a project there too,

### Installation

Start the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running the Application

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
